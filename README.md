**ABSTRACT OF THE PROJECT:**

In this project, we aim to develop a system that allows you to register for attendance with a QR code. 

Current systems use separate hardware that tends to be expensive, and it doesn't always work well. For example, biometric readers cannot be biometrically recognized under certain circumstances like rainy seasons or situations when your finger might get burnt in certain circumstances or any other technical issues as well. 

QR code is your best way to get rid of this. No additional hardware is required as it can be scanned using a device such as a mobile phone. It also tends to be faster and more reliable.

For our system, we generate a unique code for each student that contains all the important information for that student. When scanned, you can view attendance using the recorded student credentials. Credentials may also be stored in a database, which allows the associated teacher to perform all necessary operations. 

Developers can add new features to their systems with requirements-based models when needed. This is possible because it involves simply adding a new query for software that already exists.

This feature allows the development of other UI plugins that can make the experience more direct. However, this is beyond the scope of this project as it focuses only on core products. The query can be created and modified by the database administrator as needed. 

This product replaces the currently widely used bio-based attendance system. Biometric authentication systems require the installation of various infrastructures, such as fingerprint readers, in each classroom. Since our application is intended to require minimal hardware, it can be implemented using already commonly used portable devices such as mobiles.

**OBJECTIVE OF OUR PROJECT:**

To create a functional prototype of the Contactless Attendance System. Efforts will be made to create a user-friendly environment for the software. Also, as mentioned above, the software product aims to replace traditional biometric systems that require dedicated systems.

**NOVELTY IDEA:**
Contactless Attendance: In the current situation of a global pandemic caused by contact, this android application will help the users to maintain 100% contactless attendance while maintaining social distance.

Basic Approach Eradication: Currently the attendance system does not implement QR code-based system. The manual attendance system is basic, and students tend to act as a proxy of other students hence causing discrepancies in the attendance system. This system not only ensures accurate attendance but also ensures that implementing such attendance-based systems at minimum cost operation.

The above system is superior to the ID card-based attendance system because it can be operated only by the concerned student whose attendance needs to be registered. This implementation of the QR code gives the professor full control and no other person can duplicate someone else's ID.
